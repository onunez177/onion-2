a minimal html boilerplate :)

## what the heck is the .module class?

it is a wrapper for the contents of the main header, sections and footer. I often want them to be full width but the content should have a fixed width and margin

## the html

* index.html - some sample content
* blank.html - same as index.html but nothing in `<body>` except js

## the css

* colors.css - alternative colors for standard keywords such as `yellow`, `blue` or `lime` adapted from [clrs.cc](http://clrs.cc/) by mrmrs ([Github](https://github.com/mrmrs/)[Website](http://mrmrs.cc/))
* reset.css - simple reset
* structure.css - a little bit of structure
* typography.css - although this is a reset too, it is not in reset.css because in some cases you only need reset.css
